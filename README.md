### âš¡ Tech Stack and Tools i use

My tech stack **ain't that great**, but here's what I use to build awesome things:

- **React.js** for building dynamic user interfaces
- **Node.js** for building scalable server-side applications
- **Express.js** to handle routing and middleware with ease
- **MongoDB** for flexible, scalable NoSQL database solutions

I keep things simple, but they work! ðŸ’»
